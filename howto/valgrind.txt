VALGRIND HOW TO
========================

1. Using valgrind with host binaries
------------------------------------
valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --trace-children=yes $T/out/host/linux-x86/bin/crm_test_XXXXX

2. Known issue: running 32 bits binaries on 64 bits Linux host
--------------------------------------------------------------

If Valgrind shows this error message:

valgrind:  Fatal error at startup: a function redirection
valgrind:  which is mandatory for this platform-tool combination
valgrind:  cannot be set up.  Details of the redirection are:
valgrind:
valgrind:  A must-be-redirected function
valgrind:  whose name matches the pattern:      strlen
valgrind:  in an object with soname matching:   ld-linux.so.2
valgrind:  was not found whilst processing
valgrind:  symbols from the object with soname: ld-linux.so.2
valgrind:
valgrind:  Possible fixes: (1, short term): install glibc's debuginfo
valgrind:  package on this machine.  (2, longer term): ask the packagers
valgrind:  for your Linux distribution to please in future ship a non-
valgrind:  stripped ld.so (or whatever the dynamic linker .so is called)
valgrind:  that exports the above-named function using the standard
valgrind:  calling conventions for this platform.  The package you need
valgrind:  to install for fix (1) is called
valgrind:
valgrind:    On Debian, Ubuntu:                 libc6-dbg
valgrind:    On SuSE, openSuSE, Fedora, RHEL:   glibc-debuginfo
valgrind:
valgrind:  Cannot continue -- exiting now.  Sorry.


Run this command:
> sudo apt-get install libc6-dbg:i386
